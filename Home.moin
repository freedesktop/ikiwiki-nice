== The GLib ICE implementation ==

Libnice is an implementation of the IETF's draft Interactice Connectivity Establishment standard (ICE). It provides GLib-based library, libnice and [[http://www.gstreamer.net|GStreamer]] elements.

ICE is useful for applications that want to establish peer-to-peer UDP data streams. It automates the process of traversing NATs and provides security against some attacks.

Existing standards that use ICE include Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) and XMPP Jingle. 

There is full [[http://nice.freedesktop.org/libnice/|API documentation]].
