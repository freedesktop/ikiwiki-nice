== The GLib ICE implementation ==

Libnice is an implementation of the IETF's Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) standard (RFC 5245) and the Session Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN) standard (RFC 5389).

It provides a GLib-based library, libnice and a Glib-free library, libstun as well as [[http://www.gstreamer.net|GStreamer]] elements.

ICE is useful for applications that want to establish peer-to-peer UDP data streams. It automates the process of traversing NATs and provides security against some attacks.
It also allows applications to create reliable streams using a TCP over UDP layer.

Existing standards that use ICE include Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) and XMPP Jingle.
